## Overview
Anomaly detection is crucial in identifying outliers or unusual patterns in data that deviate from the norm. In this project, we focus on detecting anomalous reviews in a dataset of game reviews. The project includes data preprocessing, feature normalization, and the use of machine learning models like One-Class SVM.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implemented using One-Class SVM.
- **Visualization**: Contour plot to visualize the separation between normal and abnormal data points.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains reviews from Mobygames game platform. The features include text-based data, ratings, and other metadata. Due to privacy and proprietary concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Model
- **One-Class SVM**: A support vector machine variant tailored for anomaly detection in a single class setting.

## Results
The project provides analysis and visualization of the detected anomalies. The results show a clear separation between normal and abnormal reviews, with the models effectively identifying outliers.
